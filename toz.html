    <h3>Some thoughts on the project</h3>
    <p>
      I had worked with Unity before, but this was the first project I managed to pull through to a place where I was satisfied enough to call it "done". It is just a demo, not a full game, but I got to a point where continuing work on this project was more a matter of content and design than of actual code, so I wrapped the project up and moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working on this project I learned how Unity works, its main concepts, and how a workflow with the engine actually looks like. I also learned how to use some of specific features of it; tilesets and tilemaps, animations, and ScriptableObjects to name a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I'm pretty happy with the outcome of this project. I wanted to see if I could learn Unity by myself and make a simple game, and I managed to do it. The work was pretty fun, and adjusting gameplay based on player feedback was very rewarding.

      Finally, some credits: the art is by <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/zelda-like-tilesets-and-sprites" target="_blank">ArMM1998 on OpenGameArt</a>, with additional art by myself and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joaquingodoyart/" target="_blank">Joaqu√≠n Godoy</a>, who actually can draw. Music is by <a href="https://incompetech.com/" target="_blank">Kevin MacLeod</a>, and sounds (alongside most of the interesting bits of the game) are of course shamelessly ripped from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
