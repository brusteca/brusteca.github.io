		<div class="intro">
		<p>Hello, my name is Bruno and I'm a computer engineer. I like to make video games. I enjoy working on small, challenging projects on my free time, usually cloning something I like and putting my own cheeky spin on it.</p>

		<p>In this page you can find the result of this experimentation — plus some other stuff. Feel free to try these demos out and let me know if you like them :)</p>

				<p class="card-description">A short demo of a Zelda-like game I made in Unity. I had worked with the engine before, but this was the first project I got to a completed, playable state. I wanted to get a hold of the engine's basics with something that had simple mechanics, but used its 2D features. Playable in the browser!</p>

We built our own engine in JavaScript and implemented model loading, mapped terrain, simple physics, particles, dynamic lights and even some shadows.</p>

		<p>
		During my time at <a href="https://monkeylearn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MonkeyLearn</a> I wrote a lot for the company blog (I also implemented the blog itself, check out how fast it is!). I actually enjoyed this a lot, and we had some viral hits — at least in the small world of B2B articles about text processing. Here are some articles that I've had a hand in:

		<ul>
			<li><a href=https://monkeylearn.com/blog/trump-vs-hillary-sentiment-analysis-twitter-mentions target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"/>Trump vs Hillary: sentiment analysis on Twitter mentions</a> (this one included an interactive tool that is long gone, sadly)</li>

			Here are some texts that taught me a lot about programming. I recommend all of them:

			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="http://thecodelesscode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Codeless Code</a> by Qi. A humorous set of fables that nevertheless taught me a lot about the philosophy of programming. I find myself internally quoting some of these stories on many decisions while I'm coding.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Programming Patterns</a> by Robert Nystrom. This book taught me how a video game is actually made. It shows what the requirements of a videogame as a computer program are, and the techniques that can be used to fulfill them. Nystrom is an excellent writer, and the book is engaging from beginning to end.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://pablo.rauzy.name/dev/naur1985programming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming as Theory Building</a> by Peter Naur. The most accurate description of how software development works, and what the relationship between the programmers and the program is. Can get a bit abstract and hard to understand; <a href="https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/theory-building/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a> by Baldur Bjarnason has a good summary of the main points.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://grugbrain.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Grug Brained Developer</a>. A hilarious, satirical, and completely true guide for being a competent software developer. I think about this article at least once a week.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevey's Google Platforms Rant</a>. Just completely on point. I hope one day I can write half as engagingly as Steve Yegge.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://kupdf.net/download/programming-whit-pascal-jonh-konvalina-espa-ntilde-ol-pdf_58bc300ce12e899f08add375_pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming with Pascal</a> by John Konvalina. This book taught me programming. Pascal is extremely outdated now, but the basic concepts outlined in this book are universal and hold up to this day.
				</li>
			</ul>
