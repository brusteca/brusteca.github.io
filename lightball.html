		<h3>My thoughts on the project</h3>
		<p>
			In order to improve my Unity skills I made LIGHTBALL, an Arkanoid clone. Because the actual game mechanics are simple and mostly known I could concentrate on the implementation details, which concerned most of the new things I wanted to try. Also, since the visuals are abstract lights and shapes, I was able to rely almost entirely on myself for the visuals â€” I'm not much of a 3D modeler.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this project I tried out things I hadn't worked with before, like custom shaders, procedural generation, and Unity's physics system (just 2D in this case, since the gameplay is confined to a single plane). All the sound of the game is procedurally synthesized on the engine itself, although Unity doesn't support this on HTML5 so I had to fall back to using sound samples (bummer).
		</p>
		<p>
			Version 0.3 took me about two months of work, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I learned a lot about game design, shaders, sound, and Unity's """quirks""". I'm currently working on another iteration of it, mostly concerning the graphics, so stay tuned!
